I have  conducted an in-depth analysis of Israel Palestine conflict fatality (October,2020 - October,2023) dataset to uncover the insights and trends using Python.

1. There were some missing values, so I have replaced the missing categorical values with mode and the missing continuous values with mean.
2. There were 7 duplicate records and I dropped them.
3. I have dropped the 'notes' column as the column was not needed for our analysis.

Insights:

1. Fatalities have been skyrocketed in 2014 then it decreased.
2. Fatalities spiked significantly around 2002 and it went down later.
3. From year 2010 to 2013 fatalities were kind of stable.
4. Most fatalities are occurred in late teens to mid-twenties (19-25).
5. As the age increases the fatality count decreases i.e. less fatalities among old people.
6. The fatality of men is much higher than women.
7. Most fatalities are occurred in Gaza Strip region.
8. Based on districts most fatalities are occurred in Gaza followed by North Gaza, Khan Yunis, Rafah.
9. Significant loss of life has occurred among Palestinian individuals.
10. A significant number of fatalities involved individuals who did not take part in the hostilities.
11. Most people got injured by gunfire followed by explosion and shelling.
12. Israeli security forces are responsible for majority of the fatalities.
13. Palestine civilians and Israeli civilians are also involved but their number is comparatively lower.
14. The majority of individuals who have lost their lives in the conflict are residents of Gaza City, with subsequent high numbers in Rafah and Khan Yunis.
